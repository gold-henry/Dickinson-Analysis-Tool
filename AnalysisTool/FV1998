<b>F478A - Just once! Oh least request!</b>

Just Once! Oh Least
Request!
Could Adamant - refuse?
So small - a Grace - so
scanty - put -
So agonized Urged?

Would not a God of Flint -
Be conscious of a sigh -
As down his Heaven - dropt - remote -
echoed faint -
"Just Once"! Sweet Deity!

<b>F479A - Because I could not stop for death</b>

Because I could not
stop for Death -
He kindly stopped for me -
The Carriage held but
just Ourselves -
And Immortality.

We slowly drove - He
knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure
too,
For His Civility -

We passed the School,
where Children strove
At Recess - in the Ring -
We passed the Fields
of Gazing Grain -
We passed the Setting Sun -


Or rather - He passed
Us -
The Dews drew quivering
and Chill -
For only Gossamer, my
Gown -
My Tippet - only Tulle -

We paused before a
House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground -
The Roof was scarcely
visible -
The Cornice - in the Ground -

Since then - 'tis Centuries -
and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the
Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity -

<b>F480A - He fought like those who've nought to lose</b>

He fought like those
Who've nought to lose -
Bestowed Himself to Balls
As One who for a further
Life
Had not a further Use -

Invited Death - with bold
attempt -
But Death was shy Coy of Him
As Other Men, were Coy of Death.
To Him - to live - was Doom -

His Comrades, shifted like
the Flakes
When Gusts reverse the Snow -
But He - remained was left alive
Because
Of Urgency - â€¢ Vehemence Greediness to die -
